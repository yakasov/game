1.2 (pre)
+ Added maze randomisation system
~ Enemy counts are completely random, increasing the further out from spawn you go instead of semi-linearly as before
- Removed border overrides
? Bosses will be randomised, ie every screen a boss can spawn, a new one will be randomly created
? End Boss will be difficult
? Balance changes to make the game a little more completable
* Fixed players being able to pick up items before completing the screen


1.1
+ Implemented new enemy projectile vector system for better projection
+ Player will now take 10 damage from enemy projectiles
+ Added run.bat which will install pygame and run the game from the command line
~ Changed AQUA PLAYER_VELOCITY item from magnitude 2 to 1
~ Beautified all .dat files using JSON settings (Ctrl-J, keymap = 'ctrl-j': 'atom-beautify:beautify-language-json')
~ Beautifed all .py files using Python settings (Ctrl-K, keymap = 'ctrl-k': 'atom-beautify:beautify-language-python')
* Fixed enemy stages permanently increasing when passing Y 3
* Fixed health not updating unless taking damage
* Added error handling when exception caught when removing enemy projectiles
* Fixed bosses only having 1 health due to change in enemy data structure
* Fixed screen-specific items persisting after pickup

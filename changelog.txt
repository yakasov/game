1.2.1
+ Added enemy count randomisation system

  Bosses will get harder as the game goes on

  map: shows the map
  god: player given a large amount of health
  goto [screen]: teleport to given screen
~ Replaced old bossData format with new bossData dictionary format
- Removed enemyCounts and bosses data files
* Fixed a bug where borderOverrides was still required when finishing a screen, causing a crash


1.2 pre-release
+ Added maze randomisation system
~ Enemy counts are completely random, increasing the further out from spawn you go instead of semi-linearly as before
- Removed border overrides
* Fixed players being able to pick up items before completing the screen

? Bosses will be randomised, ie every screen a boss can spawn, a new one will be randomly created
? End Boss will be difficult
? Balance changes to make the game a little more completable

* Fixed enemy stages permanently increasing when passing Y 3

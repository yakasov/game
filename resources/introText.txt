================================================================================

Welcome to my game! :)

CONTROLS:
Arrow Keys: movement
WASD: shooting direction
C: enter command
   This will pause your game - if you do this by accident,
   click onto the console and press ENTER.

You start at screen 11. The goal is to reach screen 99.
The first digit is your X co-ordinate, and the second your Y.

Good luck!
